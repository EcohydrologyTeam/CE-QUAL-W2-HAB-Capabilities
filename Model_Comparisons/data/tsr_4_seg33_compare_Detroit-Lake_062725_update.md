# CE-QUAL-W2 Model Comparisons

These CE-QUAL-W2 model comparisons were performed by Scott Hinz, LimnoTech, and delivered by email on June 27, 2025.

## CE-QUAL-W2 Versions

Detroit Lake inputs were simulated using three different W2 version 4.5 executables:

- Original: as provided with inputs to LimnoTech
- PSU: a July 2024 executable distributed by PSU that relates to the code to which LimnoTech made changes
- Limno: LimnoTech's revised version of the PSU code to add in some of the HAB-centric capabilities
